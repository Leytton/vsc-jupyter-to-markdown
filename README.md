# Jupyter to Markdown

This is a vscode extension that converts Jupyter Notebook files (*.ipynb) to Markdown.

## Usage

Right-click the *.ipynb file and click "Convert To Markdown" to generate the *.md file in the current directory.

## Requirements

This extension works by executing the following command: 

> `jupyter nbconvert --to markdown xx.ipynb`

So the command environment needs to be supported.
